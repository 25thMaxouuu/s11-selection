# CHANGELOG

## 0.2.0 (...progress)

> Second unofficial version where I modified the views with the Bulma CDN and Material Design Icons. The first full release will be 1.0.0 and should have some optimizations for setting global variables in `./config/config.php` & others.

#### Added

- CSS stylesheet at `./src/assets/css/style.css`.
- Common Footer file at `./src/views/footer.php`.

#### Updated

- `./src/views/login` has complete CSS.
- `./src/views/admin/adminHome.php` has complete CSS.
- `./src/views/header.php` :
  - CSS file;
  - Material Design Icon;
  - Questrial Google Font;
  - First common ```<div>``` tags;

## 0.1.0 (2021-12-26)

> First unofficial version where I added the whole existing project in separate commits. The application works but has no CSS and lacks finishing touches.

### Added

- Application added to the repository
