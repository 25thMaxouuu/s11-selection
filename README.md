S11 Selection is a PHP web solution designed to automate the creation of a student's evaluation grid and then gather them to make a ranking. This application is an individual school project done during my first year.

To setup the project, use the ready-to-import database template available in `./docs/selection.sql`. The 3 accounts are `admin@admin` & `teacher@teacher` & `secr@secr`.\
Then duplicate the file named `.env.template` and rename it `.env`. Then fill in the values with your personal data. **PHP 8 or higher is required !**\
The application is then ready to use.
